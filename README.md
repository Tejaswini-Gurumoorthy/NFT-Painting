# NFT CREATION

This is a simple project that I tried which minted one of my paintings as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) using the IPFS Protocol and Pinata services. 

## Tech Stack Used:
1. Hardhat as the development environment
2. Yarn as the package manager
3. ERC20 standard for writing the NFT smart contract
4. OpenZeppelin
5. Ethers.js as the Web3 API
